- 👋 Hi, I’m @Joleneres
- 👀 I’m interested in skiing, running, and anything to stay active
- 🌱 I’m currently learning marketing analytic skills. This is a bit different from what I have done in the past, but my past psychology and counseling studies really have created a foundation here.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on marketing start ups. I mean, my profile talks about staying active, learning and more. That is all start-up culture.
